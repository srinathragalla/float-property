        <p>The Ghost, promising a smaller dose of English luxury, was made to fit tighter parking spots and days where your chauffeur takes an off. It’s a pure driver’s car, instead of a back-seat-focused luxury wagon like the Phantom. In 2009, the men at Goodwood, Sussex, wanted to build an opulent ride that could take on the BMW 7 Series, an everyday presidential ride. After 11 long years, it returns, reinvented to meet contemporary luxury standards. The twin-turbo 6.8-litre V-12 might be familiar, but otherwise, under the elegant skin, it’s a whole new Ghost.</p>
